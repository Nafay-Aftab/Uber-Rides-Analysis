## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to transform raw trip data into an **interactive, business-ready dashboard**.  
Stakeholders can use this report to:

- Monitor overall performance  
- Identify peak demand periods  
- Analyze revenue streams  
- Discover location-based trends to optimize driver distribution and pricing strategies  

---

## 2. Data Sources

The report is built using two primary CSV files:

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Trip Details.csv** | Fact table containing every trip record (timestamps, fare, distance, pickup/dropoff IDs, etc.) |
| **Location Table.csv** | Dimension table mapping `LocationID` to readable location names and cities |

✅ Table names **do not include the word “Uber”** inside Power BI.

## 4. Technical Implementation

### 📐 Data Model
Star schema structure:

- Active relationship: `PULocationID` → `LocationID`
- Inactive relationship: `DOLocationID` → `LocationID` (activated using `USERELATIONSHIP()` in DAX)

### 🔧 Power Query Transformations

| Column | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| **Trip Time (Minutes)** | Dropoff Time − Pickup Time |
| **Trip Type** | "Day" or "Night" based on pickup hour |
| **Hour, Day Name, Day of Week** | Extracted from pickup timestamp |

### 🧠 DAX Measures

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Base Measures** | `Total Bookings`, `Total Booking Value`, `Total Trip Distance` |
| **Dynamic Measure** | `[Selected Measure]` using `SWITCH()` + `SELECTEDVALUE()` |
| **Dropoff Metrics** | `CALCULATE()` + `USERELATIONSHIP()` |
| **Farthest Trip Text** | Uses `MAX()`, `FILTER()`, `LOOKUPVALUE()`, `CONCATENATE()` to return readable trip details |
